# Side Projects

Projects I create for fun that may not be completely polished. More details on each project are in their respective subdirectory.

## Even Count

Iterates through all digits in a .txt file and displays how many are even. Optimized for large data sets like pi available at <https://archive.org/details/Math_Constants> or <https://archive.org/details/pi_dec_1t>. The operation done at each digit can be modified.

A simple GUI and calculater made with Tkinter. Given a distance, a rate of consumption, and a price, calculate the money spent.
